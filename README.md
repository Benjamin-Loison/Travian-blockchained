# Travian blockchained
Travian powered by blockchain technology using proof-of-stake to remove all buy gold stuff

An assumption done in this project is that the majority of users are following the protocol. (if want to avoid "fake majority" (by someone creating a lot of fake virtual users) just have to force one IP per user creation)
It is recommended to have a permanent node connected in order to give pieces of information to initializing node. Afterwards if the only node helping for initialization was lying will get again pieces of information from new majority, hoping that the decisions took by the initializing node wouldn't change with these new pieces of information (or should warn the initializing node).
